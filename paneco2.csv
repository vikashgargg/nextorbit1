Exemplifying the family’s tradition of innovation, our 15 Year Old expression is created using a technique pioneered by our Malt Master and its warm, spicy flavours are transformed with the alchemy of the Solera Vat.Many claim that the Glenfiddich 15 is the best edition of the Glenfiddich brand. The whiskey was aged in American bourbon barrels, Portuguese sherry barrels, and virgin oak barrels. Then the whiskey was married using the Solera method, which provides the whiskey with flavors of sweet sherry and a guaranteed and uniform quality in each and every bottle. The production and aging methods of the Glenfiddich 15 year old are the first of their kind in the world. The writing ""Solera"" in the name of the whiskey marks the aging method of the Spanish sherry, where in each stage a younger beverage is transferred into a barrels that already contains aged beverage.Aged in European oak sherry casks and new oak casks, the whisky is mellowed in our unique Solera Vat, a large oak tun inspired by the sherry bodegas of Spain and Portugal.

This is a blended of malt and grain whiskies. It has the name simply due to the color of the label.Eigashima Shuzo Co. Ltd. is one of the oldest family-run distillery with nearly 100 years of whisky-making experience in Japan.

Known for its clean air and water, the city of Akashi is located in close proximity of Osaka, which overlooks the beautiful Seto Inland Sea; Akashi is the only distillery in Japan situated by the sea.

Akashi whisky is the only whisky in the world that is made by a Toji (grand-master in the art of sake making) by implementing sake-making methodologies into the whisky making process. The distil pot used is smaller than those used by both Scottish and other Japanese distilleries, which in turn, decreases the levels of fusel alcohol. As a result, Akashi whisky does not require as long of an ageing process, while its core malt (cask strength) is smooth and delicate.Akashi White Oak is a blended whisky reserved in Japanese Shochu cask (American Oak) for 3 years, aged in ex-bourbon casks before finishing in ex-sherry casks for 2 years.

Throughout the Scottish uplands, most extensively in the north and west, you will find the heart of the peatlands.  Remote and isolated yet rich in iconic wildlife, this environment rules the landscape and provides a valuable fuel for the whisky-making process.Peatiness can be controlled by the amount of peat burnt and the humidity of the barley. Peat smoke produces chemicals called phenols and it is by its phenol content that a whisky's 'peatiness' can be measured. This phenol content is expressed as PPM (parts per million) and to ensure consistency, Peatheart uses barley, specified by the Master Blender, malted to 40PPM.

The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types. To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called “tuns” for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to “marry”.  Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously.

Named after the Gaelic for ‘dawn’, Moch is an amazing new Caol Ila single malt. Lighter than the standard 12yo, makes it a fantastic easy-drinking dram. For more than 100 years small coal-fired “puffers” like the SS Pibroch brought barley, coal and empty casks to the distillery, returning her whisky to the mainland through the Sound of Islay. Today, Caol Ila’s secret bay is only known to true Islay devotees. The barley used here is still malted locally at Port Ellen and pure spring water still rises from limestone in nearby Loch nam Ban, then falls to the sea at Caol Ila in a clear crystal stream, just as it always has. The distinctive Islay smokiness makes Caol Ila whisky a reference point for connoisseurs of Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky the world over. It’s dry, sea air aromas and pleasing smoky-smoothness evokes a certain sense of place for the drinker – whether you’ve visited this magical island or not.

In 1263, Colin of Kintail, Chief of the Clan Mackenzie, took a bold decision to stand up and be counted, and felled a charging stag which attacked King Alexander III of Scotland. In return for saving his life, the grateful King gifted the 12-pointed Royal Stag emblem to the Mackenzie Clan as a reward.When descendants of the Mackenzie Clan took over the ownership of The Dalmore distillery in 1867, they continued to honour this brave act and proudly put the 12-pointed Royal Stag on the bottle. To this day, the Stag still adorns each and every bottle of The Dalmore.To celebrate the pioneering and innovative values of the Mackenzie Clan, their Master Distiller has painstakingly created the only single malt in the world to unite a unique six cask finish for one outstanding achievement. Spirits matured in ex-bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry butts, Madeira barrels, Marsala casks, Port pipes and Cabernet Sauvignon wine barriques are combined in perfect harmony to create a uniquely complex, yet smooth single malt. This is the embodiment of brave creativity and a lifetime’s experience.

For me, the location of Edradour, with its neat cluster of whitewashed buildings, traditional equipment and employment of ancient methods of making single malt whisky, combined with its state of the art bottling facility, typify Caledonia. So it is great to be joining forces with Andrew Symington and Edradour Distillery, to bring you this wonderfully rich and complex 12 year old single malt.” Dougie MacleanAt a strength of 46% ABV and non chill-filtered, Caledonia retains maximum flavour with great depth and body.

The 15 Year Old gets its distinctive rich and exotic character from a process of selective maturation in which a proportion of the spirit is matured in French oak casks. In fact, we at The Glenlivet were one of the first to use French oak for making whisky, a technique that has since been imitated the world over.The Limousin oak we use is cut in France’s Dordogne region, where it’s often used to mature cognacs. Its low density allows whisky to sink deep into the wood, and we carefully control how long the whisky matures in the casks so as not to overpower the desired result: a unique, pleasing spiciness.This process increases the intensity of the whisky, creating a rich, creamy finish, with buttery notes. The 15 Year Old is deep gold in colour, and leaves behind traces of sweet almond and spice. It’s luxury in a glass.

                  The whiskey's unique character stems from its aging in selected barrels only. Part of the drink is aged in French Limousin wooden barrels, also used to age cognac and high-quality wines, for a limited time only, in order not to overshadow the rest of the beverage. The French wood enhances the strength of the whiskey, and creates a richer, creamier finish.

The Nàdurra First Fill is drawn from casks made of American white oak which have never before been used to mature Scotch whisky. These oak casks, which distillers at The Glenlivet have favoured since the early 1900s, impart hints of creamy vanilla to this wonderfully rich single malt. You’ll really taste the effects of that white oak, beautifully complemented by sweet pear, tropical pineapple, ripe banana and citric sparkle. This is a cask-strength single malt that represents the skill of our team and the tradition of The Glenlivet. And unlike most modern whiskies, this one is non-chill filtered, so it’s very richly textured. It’s an expression that will appeal to the intrepid whisky lover.

Nàdurra Oloroso, like all expressions in the range, is bottled and released in small batches, and, unlike most modern whiskies, is non-chill filtered so has all the body you would expect from a whisky that has been drawn straight from the cask. It’s a bright, vivacious gold liquid, with aromas of dried fruit and spice. To drink, it’s smooth and creamy with chocolate and marmalade. This is a divine example of what happens when you bring together Spanish passion and Speyside tradition. This whisky is all about using traditions to achieve modern brilliance.

Unlike its two siblings, the Nàdurra Peated Whisky is finished in casks that previously held heavily peated Scotch whisky, giving a gently smoky twist to the classic, smooth and fruity house style that The Glenlivet is known for.

To earn this distinction, a whiskey had to be distilled at a single distillery during a single distilling season, aged at least four years and be bottled at 100 proof. 120 years later, the Bottled in Bond Act is proof of America’s commitment to ensuring the quality of whiskey.

Jameson Black Barrel is a tribute to the cooper’s method of charring barrels. Charring is an age old method for invigorating barrels, but these days we use double charred barrels by choice rather than through necessity. Time spent maturing in these barrels lends this whiskey intensified notes of vanilla sweetness and caramel, alongside toasted wood, fruit, and warm spice. A triple distilled blend of ‘small batch’ grain and traditional Irish pot still whiskeys, Jameson Black Barrel reveals untold richness and complexity. Every barrel contains secrets; the trick is coaxing them out.A triple distilled, twice charred, one of a kind.

Emerging from a conversation between our head distiller and the head brewer of Cork’s Franciscan Well Brewery, Jameson Caskmates has been finished in stout-seasoned whiskey casks.

                  Johnnie Walker Double Black is a full-bodied whisky, with an intense smoky character and layers of spice, inspired by our iconic Johnnie Walker Black Label. Strongly influenced by powerful West Coast and Island whiskies, with a delicious scent of sweet smoke and cloves.

This evolves to a wonderfully long, warming finish; the smoldering spice from oak-aged casks makes for a powerful and lingering smokiness.

On the far edge of the Scotch whisky map, it's supposed that the art of distillation was first brought to Islay by Irish monks. Being remote, it’s an art that flourished in the hands of the islanders, whose illegal operations tested the resolve and means of the tax man. Eventually, the law relaxed, various whisky makers set up legitimate distilleries, among them a pair of farmers, Donald and Alexander Johnston, who in 1815 founded their distillery on the island’s south coast. Laphroaig, so called after its location, ‘broad hollow by the bay.’ It would remain in family hands for the next 139 years. Find out more about the history of Laphroaig below, using the scroller on the timeline to travel back in time.The Port Sherry Cask edition was originally made for Travel Retail.

Laphroaig Quarter Cask offers an irresistible doubling of flavour, due to the double maturation in two barrels made of American oak. Still-maturing whisky from our standard ex-bourbon barrels is transferred to quarter casks and left to rest in our warehouse just a stone’s throw from the Atlantic shore.This process represents Laphroaig breathing new life into a once-defunct tradition: the use of the smaller cask size, which ensures increased contact with the oak, creating a soft and velvety edge to complement Laphroaig’s distinctive peatiness.On the nose the sensation is toffee and caramel, caused by the vanillas and tannins of the American oak, plus a dryness from the wood oil. The finish is long and alternates between this sweetness and smoke.

Laphroaig Select takes its name from the special selection of American and European casks, chosen for their unique character that they give during maturation. Our Inspiration for their new Global expression has been take from history – 70-80 years ago, the time of the last family member owner of the distillery, Ian Hunter. Ian was one of the biggest influences in the history of Laphroaig indeed he was one of the first distillers to travel to bourbon county in the USA to identify new sources of casks that would give him greater consistency as well as new flavours. He later married this ‘new’ style of Laphroaig with his traditionally matured (European cask) Laphroaig.Inspired by his early work , they have used Oloroso sherry butts, straight American white oak (non-filled with bourbon), PX seasoned hogsheads, Quarter Casks and finally of course first fill Bourbon Casks. This varied cask maturation technique enabled us to create 6 new flavour combinations that were then tested with our FOL’s to choose their favourite style and indeed name. The winning flavour and name chosen by you is LAPHROAIG SELECT.

Triple Wood is an extension of the Quarter Cask expression and is special for its triple maturation, which creates a unique blend of our signature peat-smoked liquid with softer notes of fruit and spices.

When tasted, Triple Wood begins with a subtle sherry sweetness before offering up spiciness and nuttiness and a huge peat flavour.

It is often said that when two worlds come together, they create something magical, or simply extraordinary.  For us, this is the absolute truth behind our new 12 year old single malt; The Macallan Double Cask. This is a single malt which tells the story of a journey; a story which brings together different worlds.  To create Double Cask, we bring new oak from America across thousands of miles to Spain, where oak casks are crafted and sherry seasoned before travelling to our distillery on Speyside to mature for twelve years. These whiskies are then harmoniously united with those aged in the very best sherry seasoned European oak casks.  This union reveals an unmatched investment in time and extraordinary commitment to mastery for which The Macallan has been known since 1824. Exclusively sherry seasoned, The Macallan Double Cask 12 Years Old delivers a distinct American oak style, reflecting a perfect harmony of flavours and natural colour.   The delicate flavour of American oak – vanilla, citrus and light oak – rises in prominence as the traditional Macallan character of rich fruit, sherry and wood spice affords a familiar back drop. This is a flavour combination which is guaranteed until the very last drop.

460,Paddy Irish Whiskey 1L,71.25,https://www.paneco.com.sg/products/paddy-irish-whiskey-1l,"
Paddy is one of Ireland’s favourite whiskeys and is the only major Irish whiskey to use single malt in its blend, thus creating its uniquely rich & mellow flavour. First distilled in 1779, the whiskey originally sold under the unlikely name “Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey” until a young salesman by the name of Paddy Flaherty joined the company in 1881. Paddy was a larger than life character who became famous in his native county for standing rounds of his favourite whiskey. Over time, Paddy became synonomous with the whiskey and publicans began writing to the distillery asking for another case of “Paddy’s whiskey”. Despite frequent differences of opinion with his employers concerning his unconventional sales techniques, the “Paddy whiskey” name stuck so much so that in 1912, the distillery owners bowed to public pressure and officially changed the name to “Paddy Irish Whiskey”. It could only happen in Ireland!Paddy Whiskey is distilled three times from the finest quality barley and water. This ensures a whiskey, which is particularly light, well balanced and pure.Its relatively low pot-still content and uniquely high proportion of malt whiskey, ensures Paddy is one of the softest of all Ireland's whiskeys.During maturation in oak casks stored in dark aromatic warehouses for up to seven years, Paddy whiskey mellows, and takes on it's distinctive rich, golden colour.Two percent of Paddy Whiskey is lost to the atmosphere during maturation. This evaporated whiskey has come to be called 'The Angel's Share'.

Bourbon is America’s native spirit, and 95% of it comes from Kentucky.To call your bourbon Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey it must be aged in new, charred oak barrels for at least 2 years and be made in Kentucky.AWARDS

It has been bottled at 46%, without chillfiltration, to retain the true cask character.The name Ballechin originates from a fellow Perthshire farm distillery, which sadly closed its doors in 1927. There, Alfred Barnard, who catalogued all the distilleries in the UK in the 1880’s, made reference to having experienced a peated whisky.

To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months.The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called “tuns” for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to “marry”.Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously.The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types.

The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2003 Vintage) is the result of trials undertaken in 2001 by The Balvenie Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE and our former distillery manager Ian Millar.At a time when few Speyside distilleries were using peat in production, The Balvenie decided to distil a batch of heavily peated malt, which was laid down to mature at the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland.Ever since then we’ve dedicated one week each year, named Peat Week, to using 100% Highland peat to dry our barley. Instead of coastal elements of iodine, salt and medicinal characteristics so commonly associated with Islay peat, Highland peat imparts earthy, woody smoke notes. This means that even though Peat Week is made using heavily peated malt (30ppm) it has an unexpected sweetness deeply rooted in the Speyside regional character. The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2003 Vintage) is a single vintage bottling, limited and rare by nature. This non-chill filtered expression is bottled at 48.3% ABV and matured solely in American Oak casks, providing a velvety and round taste with woody peat smoke balancing oaky vanilla and honey.This is a Paneco.com exclusive!

In Victorian times, when Bruichladdich Distillery was built, all Scottish barley was organically grown. The relationship between distiller, farmer and soil was intimate and enduring. These ties were lost as industrialised farming cut through ancient synergies and an age of super efficient blandness was born.In partnership with our organic farmers – Sir William Roberts of Mains of Tullibardine, William Rose at Mid Coull and Neil Scobie at Coulmore – we are rediscovering these synergies. We believe relationships matter. Once again, land and dram united.

The secret to making Asyla is the quality of the casks. They use only whiskies aged in first-fill American oak casks because these yield whiskies with more vanilla character, more richness and more sweetness than refill casks. Asyla is made with 50% malt whisky. There are few blended Scotches that use as high a malt content as we do at Compass Box. The result is a carefully crafted, elegant blended Scotch whisky that makes the perfect aperitif.Asyla is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty-smokycharacter of The Peat Monster and the elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel.

Hedonism is unusual in the Scotch whisky world: a blended grain Scotch whisky. It is very rare to see 100% grain whisky bottlings, in Scotland. Going back 100 years, grain whisky brands were more common, but they were overtaken in popularity by the big brands of blended Scotch, which comprised both grain whisky and malt whisky. Today, most Scotch grain whisky gets blended into the big brand names, typically at young ages. For Hedonism, we search for old casks of Scotch grain whisky. And we only produce Hedonism once a year, when we  nd casks with the right  avour pro le.When good Scotch grain whisky is aged in good quality American oak casks, the results can be stunning: a rich, sweet, alluring whisky, redolent of vanilla, pastry cream and coconut.

645,Compass Box Oak Cross 750ml w/Gift Box,127,https://www.paneco.com.sg/products/compass-box-oak-cross-750ml-w-gift-box,"
This whisky is called Oak Cross because it offers the best characteristics of both American and French oak aging. A rich, medium-bodied blended malt Scotch whisky, Oak Cross combines vanilla characters from American oak and spicy, clove-like characters from French oak.They work with a small mill in France that produces some of the highest quality cooperage oak in the world. It was our work with this mill that led us to experimenting with secondary maturation of malt whiskies in casks  tted with new French oak heads. This is something no one else in Scotland does. The result is whisky with more character and complexity. This technique is used on about 40% of the whisky in Oak Cross and it results in a superior finished product.Oak Cross is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant  avours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from casks chosen individually, cask-by-cask, to ensure perfect maturity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel.

Boasting the classic flavours of The Glenlivet bound up in a creamy, smooth texture, this expression is their tribute to the one who started it all.George Smith, the founder, was a trailblazer with an irrepressible spirit. In creating a whisky in his honour they were understandably keen to do him justice. The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve captures the distinct, smooth, fruity taste that he first envisioned in 1824 and for which they are still renowned today. And because they remain as dedicated to innovation as their founder ever was, they have given this classic single malt a contemporary twist.To truly capture the essence of George Smith’s vision, The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve has been created using the time-honoured distillation methods that he introduced so long ago. Made with water from the same crystal-clear mountain streams, in the same cold, pure air, The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve is as smooth and fruity as the whisky that first ran from the original copper pot stills. These unique, lantern-shaped copper stills, designed by the man himself, are not the only important tools in thier distilling legacy.The traditional oak casks in which they mature the whisky give each expression its own distinct characteristics. When George Smith began distilling, The Glenlivet had no age statements and he selected whisky from casks of a range of ages. They have replicated this freedom with The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, selecting whisky from a variety of traditional aged oak casks. Then, to lend a modern twist to the flavour of the expression, Master Distiller Alan Winchester marries together a selection of the aged oak casks and American first-fill oak casks. American first-fill oak casks are those that have never before been used to mature Scotch Whisky. Selective use of these casks provides a smooth, creamy sweetness that mingles harmoniously with the delicate flavours and complex fruity tones already present in the whisky.

The Glenlivet legacy lives on in this incredibly sweet and smooth spirit.The cornerstone of the range, the Master Distiller’s Reserve showcases the approach perfectly: the traditional oak casks represent the classic style of The Glenlivet (ripe pear, gentle summery notes), while first-fill American oak provides depth and creaminess (coconut, soft fudge). Finally, ex-sherry oak brings complexity and richness (dried fruit, spice). Maturation in three types of oak makes for three times the character. This bright and lively gold expression has pear and fudge on the nose and fruit and spice on the palate. To finish, it dazzles with hints of marzipan and hazelnut. With so many flavours, this is a spirit to savour… make sure you seek it out next time you travel.Available exclusively in Singapore at Paneco.com.

Only 7 master distillers have been involved in the manufacturing process of this whiskey, the uniqueness of which is in its distillation process, carried out through maple wood charcoal for two weeks. And indeed, it is rich with sweet flavors and has a juicy complexion. The whiskey belongs to the whiskey Tennessee family and is produced from a combination of barley, malt and corn with pure spring water.Only seven men have served as Master Distiller. This special bottling celebrates Mr. Jess Motlow, who saw the Distillery through Prohibition.

                  (94 proof) Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel whiskey is as individual as the variations in the oak wood from barrel to barrel. As a result, bottles drawn from individual barrels will offer subtle differences in nose, color and taste. It is a dark amber single barrel whiskey, that rests in the upper floors of the warehouses where the whiskey’s color and taste deepen and mature an extra measure. Master Distiller Jeff Arnett and a team of tasters select the whiskey when it reaches its peak maturity. They taste for a singular combination–the robust flavor of a single barrel and the smooth character of Jack Daniel’s. What finally emerges from the wood is a bold full-bodied whiskey with heightened flavors of toasted oak, vanilla and caramel. Stands up to the richest of cigars.

Jameson Black Barrel is a tribute to the cooper’s method of charring barrels. Charring is an age old method for invigorating barrels, but these days we use double charred barrels by choice rather than through necessity. Time spent maturing in these barrels lends this whiskey intensified notes of vanilla sweetness and caramel, alongside toasted wood, fruit, and warm spice. A triple distilled blend of ‘small batch’ grain and traditional Irish pot still whiskeys, Jameson Black Barrel reveals untold richness and complexity. Every barrel contains secrets; the trick is coaxing them out.A triple distilled, twice charred, one of a kind.
