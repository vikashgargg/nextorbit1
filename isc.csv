This distillery is ‘landmark’, not only in location but also a modern-day icon and training site for expert distillers such as Alan Winchester. At Glen Keith, these experts learnt to make their mark on a Scotch whisky, producing incredible malts that were Speyside, through and through. <br />Awards & Recognitions: ISC 2020 - Gold, IWSC 2020 - Silver",,GLEN-KEITH-28-YEARS-OLD-SINGLE-MALT-WHISKY-700ML---SECRET-SPEYSIDE

Blender George Harper used the Frozen North as his starting point for creating White Walker by Johnnie Walker. He said: “Whiskies from Clynelish have endured long, Scottish Winters, not dissimilar to the long periods endured by the Night’s Watch who have ventured north of the wall - so it was the perfect place to start when creating this unique whisky.”<br /><br />This limited edition blend brings you right to the Frozen North with an icy white and blue design along with the iconic Johnnie Walker Striding Man now fashioned in armour to fit in among the ranks of the Night King’s forces.

Blender George Harper used the Frozen North as his starting point for creating White Walker by Johnnie Walker.

At the heart of this limited-edition whisky lies the Highland single malt, Glenury Royal - a ‘ghost’ distillery that shut its doors in 1985 after a long and colourful history.

Founded in 1825 by Captain Robert Barclay, who was a member of the British Parliament and the first man to walk one thousand miles in one thousand hours, the distillery was destroyed in a fire, only to rise once again and flourish under Barclay’s leadership to become one of only three Scottish distilleries to have a Royal title.

Johnnie Walker Master Blender, Dr. Jim Beveridge, has long been passionate about exploring the unique flavours found in these exceptionally rare whiskies. Jim says: “Shining a light on this hidden treasure of the whisky world is something we’ve wanted to do for some time. This indulgent new limited edition provides us with a wonderful opportunity to explore the remarkable layers of rich fruit found in every drop of Johnnie Walker Blue Label.”

Jim crafted Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare Glenury Royal by blending the highly sought-after “ghost” whiskies from Cambus and Pittyvaich, with five incredibly rare malts from Glen Elgin, Inchgower, Glenlossie, Cameronbridge and Glenkinchie.

The result is a whisky with smooth, nutty layers of dark chocolate, waves of vanilla, heather honey and dried fruits and underlying notes of creamy toffee and butterscotch - all perfectly balanced by the rich,fruity, sweet apple and delicate apricot character of Glenury Royal.",,Johnnie-Walker-Blue-Label-Ghost---Rare-Glenury-Royal-750ml

Nara is the ancient capital of Japan and it holds many temples from Shinto, Tengri and Buddhist religions, which makes Nara «The City of Temples». Kamiki production is protected by Omiwa Temple priests. Omiwa is one of the oldest extant Shinto shrine in Japan over thousand years old and protecting local alcohol producers ever since. To celebrate the timeless alcohol tradition of the region, rare Japanese malt whiskies and finest malt whiskies sourced from rest of the world are blended and later fused with the highest quality pure spring water. Nara is covered with dense Yoshino Sugi (Japanese Cedar) forests. Yoshino Sugi is used to build temples, burnt in temples to calm mind and to age local alcohol products. Kamiki uses a unique second maturation technique, while blend is rested for a second time in Yoshino Sugi –Japanese Cedar- casks to capture a perfectly smooth taste, a scent of sandalwood on the nose and a zest of green tea in the finish. This second maturation makes Kamiki; “THE FIRST WHISKY IN THE WORLD WITH JAPANESE CEDAR CASK FINISH”! Kamiki name is derived from the Miwa Mountain (Mountain of God), which is protected by Omiwa Priests. Inspired by beautiful breezes coming from Miwa, the whisky is named KAMIKI, where KAMI means God and IKI means breath. Nara is as well home to Thousands of Sakura Trees, planted long ago by priests to worship nature. Sakura tree symbolizes the fragility of life with its beautiful yet short-lived blossoms and has been part of Japanese culture for centuries through the spring ceremony of HANAMI – Cherry Blossom viewing. Inspired by sacred Sakura tree and timeless traditions of Nara, we curated Kamiki SAKURA. Kamiki SAKURA is an exclusive version of Kamiki ORIGINAL whereby the blend is aged in Sakura casks at the final stage after it is rested in Yoshino-Sugi casks. This two-step cask finish brings the essence Yoshino Sugi and Sakura wood with a distinct warming woodiness that reminds Nara forests with sandalwood and gentle spice, before sweet cherries notes. There is no age statement on the product. It has been aged in oak barrels minimum of three years and second aged in non-charred local cedar casks and finally Sakura casks to bring the taste of Nara forests in a whisky bottle to the world. Kamiki SAKURA has got acknowledgements from: <br />•	“DOUBLE GOLD” medal from 2019 Cigar & Spirits Magazine Competition <br />•	“GOLD” medal from 2019 China Wine and Spirits Awards. <br />•	“91 Points” from 2020 Ultimate Spirit Challange. <br />•	“PLATINUM” Award from 2019 SIP Awards <br />•	“DOUBLE GOLD” Award from 2019 Women’s Wine & Spirit Awards. <br />•	“CONSUMER’S CHOICE” Award from 2019 SIP Awards <br />•	“INNOVATION” Award from 2019 SIP Awards <br />•	“DOUBLE GOLD” from 2019 Las Vegas Spirit Awards<br />•	“GOLD” from 2019 San Diego Spirit Awards TASTING NOTES <br />•	Nose: Cherry candy with ripe banana, chestnuts, and cinnamon on the nose.<br />•	Palate: Woodiness, sandalwood and gentle spice, before sweet Sakura pedals. <br />•	Finish: Spicy cherry with savory notes, leading to a floral, spring-like finish",,KAMIKI-SAKURA-MALT-WHISKY-500ML-48-

He’d been inspired by the bustling saloons of Nashville, and wanted to bring some of those good times to his hometown. He knew it’d bring the townsfolk of Lynchburg together. In fact, he was so inspired, he opened not one bar, but two. The sophisticated White Rabbit Saloon, and the not-so-sophisticated Red Dog Saloon. Now, we don’t know much about the Red Dog Saloon. All pictures have been lost to time.<br /><br />And those who knew the story have kept tight-lipped through the years. Even its name is a mystery. Did Jack have a loyal hound that was red in color? Were the curtains in the saloon made of red velvet? Or did the stories that were told there turn the patrons’ cheeks a shade of red?<br /><br />One thing’s for sure. Mr. Jack always knew the right ways to bring folks together. After all, to this day, Old No. 7 is still served in fine establishments and questionable joints everywhere.<br /><br />TASTING NOTES<br /><br />As you raise the glass, you pick up aromas of soft ripe fruit with green apple peel and warm oak.
